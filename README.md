## In the lab for Applied Machine Learning we took data from a csv file, came up with different counts in the data, made visuals to find the distributions of the different features in the data, added new features to the data, and finally created a split for data that will be in the training set and data that will be in the test set.  This is all in preparation to do some different machine learning classifying techniques.
